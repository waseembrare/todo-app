# DoMore ToDo List Application

A todo app built using the Slim framework. 

Using a minimalistic UI so the user can focus on the tasks at hand, DoMore allows users to create, delete and mark tasks as completed or uncompleted. 

## To Setup Project Locally...

### Install the Application

Create a new directory with your project name, e.g:


```bash
mkdir academyProject
```

Once inside the new directory, clone this repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mayden-Academy/slim4-skeleton.git .
```

One cloned, you must install the slim components by running:

```bash
composer install
```

To run the application locally:
```bash
composer start

```
Run this command in the application directory to run the test suite
```bash
composer test
```

That's it!
